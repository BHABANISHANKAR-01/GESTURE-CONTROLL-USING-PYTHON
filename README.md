# GESTURE-CONTROLL-USING-PYTHON
A  python based project using open cv .In this project we can control the music of a pc using hand gesture.
In this project we are going to control some functionalities with some body postures.
Before controlling anything we have to detect it.
We have used Open CV and Mediapipe .
We have created a hand detecting code which will detect hand in the first phase and then we have converted this code file to a module which  we will use in further use.
